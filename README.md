sabrabbr
========

Chrome Extension that displays the definition of commonly used baseball acronyms. I have absolutely no idea
how optimal this is. Please let me know if you find a better way of doing this. Thanks!

Installation
-------
There are 2 ways to install in Chrome:

* 	Method 1: Clone this repo directly from github. In `chrome://extensions` activate `Developer mode` and load the extension
	by clicking `Load unpacked extension...`. This will allow you to modify the extension if you so desired. You can also click
	`Pack extension...` to create your own `.crx` file. 

*	Method 2: Download only the `.crx` file. Launch Chrome and drag/drop the file into `chrome://extensions`. Enjoy.

Usage
-------
Once installed, the extension will automatically append `<abbr>` tags to commonly used acronyms. Simply mouseovering will
show a more complete definition. All definitions were taken from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics "Baseball Statistics at Wikipedia"). Ironically the extension does not work on Wikipedia.
