sabrabbr
========

Chrome Extension that displays the definition of commonly used baseball acronyms.  This is my first Chrome extension so it might not be all that (I'm also not very good at JS so again, I apologise for bugs).

Installation
-------
There are 2 ways to install in Chrome:

* 	Method 1: Clone this repo directly from github. In `chrome://extensions` activate `Developer mode` and load the extension
	by clicking `Load unpacked extension...`. This will allow you to modify the extension if you so desired. You can also click
	`Pack extension...` to create your own `.crx` file. 

*	Method 2: Download only the `.crx` file. Launch Chrome and drag/drop the file into `chrome://extensions`. Enjoy.
